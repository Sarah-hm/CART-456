# CART-456

## Internship by Sarah Hontoy-Major,

Under the supervision of Pippin Barr and Sabine Rosenberg

## Schedule V1.0

(There may very well be 12 versions of this schedule :] )

### Week 1:

- Looking into other solutions than D3 (is it really the technology I want/need to learn?);
- Surface research on the library’s documentation and organizing topics with specific sections;
- Putting all of that in a cohesive and somewhat sensible 12 week-long schedule;
- Starting on a first introductory tutorial here.

### Week 2 (24 sept): Introduction to D3 and data and shapes

- Intro: tutorial /d3-axis, /d3-color;
- /D3-polygon, /D3-shape;
- /D3-fetch.

### Week 3 (21 sept): Map projections (!!!)

- Cylindrical Projections (and maybe Azimuthal)
- (/d3-geo/cylindrical,D3-geo/d3-geo/stream)
- By now, I should be able to emulate by data_scapes project (built on leaflet.js and svg.js using only D3)

### Week 4 (28 sept): Interpolating

- Between values and zoom

### Week 5 (5 oct): More (complicated) shape

- D3-shapes: line, curves;
- arcs (possibly at week 9).

### Week 6 (12 oct):

- Write first tutorial ???

### Week 7 (19 oct): Animation

- D3-ease/D3-timer/d3-transition

### Week 8 (26 oct): User interaction

- /D3-dispatch, /D3-drag, /D3-zoom

### Week 9 (2 nov): Different ways to visualize data

- Chord diagrams (/d3-chord)

### Week 10 (9 nov): More map projections

- Custom projections (/d3-geo/projections)

### Week 11 (16 nov):

\*Writing second tutorial

### Week 12 (23 nov): Extra (hierarchies)

- /D3-hierarchy/tree (dynamic cladogram)

### Week 13 (30 nov): Extra (physics)

- /D3-force

## Week 1

#### Week's goals

This week’s objectives will focus on arranging a comprehensive schedule for the internship, pointing towards specific steps, processes, and lectures/tutorials that will be completed and/or produced. I will also implement a structure for journaling and archiving all ongoing and completed progress in my internship’s goals. I will also attempt a more precise explanation of aforementioned internship goals, though they may morph, especially in the coming weeks.
The goals, schedule, and steps produced today will structure my internship, but it is highly likely I will have to modify and redirect them when it becomes of interest to do so. Because of this, I will reassess my goals and consequential schedule at the beginning of every week, as well as specify more concrete tasks to be completed.
This week’s, my tasks will be:

- Creating a 12 week schedule that will insure ongoing efforts towards my first-level goals, with specific self-imposed deadlines;
- This schedule should include specific tutorials and topics to be completed/researched as part of my hours, including D3 specificities relevant to my own research and practice goals, and critical theory that apply to the intertwinement of D3 library with my practice (of data story-telling and the science of hierarchies);
- Creating a GitHub repo to put all this and have Sabine and Pippin read it :).

#### Week's notes

Although the week did not go as planned (surprise), I still learned a lot on how to manage my time better. I expected to be able to do tutorial work at the CLAB on Thursday, and I obviously cannot concentrate much in there, yet (WIP). Next week I will plan accordingly, and do the heavy lifting in the morning with no one in the lab, and plan my writing during the day. My writing can be interrupted by conversation and questions, but my programming hardly can.
Although I had not planned it (yet), I was able to assist someone in building their CART398 (creative intelligence?) homework, which I absolutely loved. It’s one thing to write the code for myself (or someone else), but explaining why you are writing what and where, and letting them slowly (actually) get it, is really rewarding.
In programming, I just feel like there is always something else, newer, better, to learn. I have a hard time staying stagnant when I get good at something; I want to go be bad at something else, so that I can eventually be good at that too. I therefore spend a lot of time being ‘bad’ at things (manual skills, languages, libraries, … ); being genuinely helpful to someone and having fun doing it (his game was really funny to make and test) makes me realize I have come a long way since writing my first line of code.
